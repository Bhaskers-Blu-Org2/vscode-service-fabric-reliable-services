## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something

## Known Issues

When generating C# Service Fabric projects on Windows, the path in the generated build script contains / instead of \ . This will 
trigger an error that the proj file cannot be found when trying to build the application.

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

creating, building, and deploying applications within the VS Code editor.
